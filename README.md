# EE2016-Lab-Experiments

4 Lab experiments done as part of the course EE2016

First 2 Experiments are based AVR assembly programming and rest 2 are ARM assembly programming

## Experiment 1
Implement basic arithmetic and logical manipulation programs using Atmel Atmega8 microcontroller in assembly
language simulation, including addition, multiplication, and comparison.

## Experiment 2
Implementation of interrupts and timers in Atmel Atmega microprocessor using assembly and C-interface

## Experiment 3
Writing ARM assembly programs for some computational problems.

## Experiment 4
Stepper motor control using ARM C-programming.
Read the status (binary position) of the switch and use the LEDs to display the status of each of the 8-bit DIP switch
